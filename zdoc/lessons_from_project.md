I learned the benefit of `related_name `

One-to-many Relationship:
Instance of B:
One user can have multiple images.
An image can only be to one user

many-to-many Relationship:
One user can like multiple images.
An image can be liked by multiple users

When you need to repeat a queryset in your template, use the {% with %} template tag to avoid additional database queries. Ensure there is no space between the equal sign.
